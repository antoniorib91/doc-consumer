This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

## Development server

To before run ng server you need to install a browser plugin to pass CORS problems.

I used local server make request and the modern browser like a chrome, opera have blocked
cors to local servers.
